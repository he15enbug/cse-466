## Evolution of DRM
- Anti-debugging: techniques to fight dynamic analysis
- VMing: wrapping the DRM code in a heavily obfuscated, protected emulator for a custom architecture, with the DRM logic inside that architecture
- Trusted Execution Environments: moving the DRM outside of the CPU into protected hardware
